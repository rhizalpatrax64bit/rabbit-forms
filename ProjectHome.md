# Rabbit Forms #

Rabbit Forms is a CRUD (Create Retrieve Update Delete) automate library. If you see, more than 80% of a system development is based on CRUD operations, Rabbit Forms is made to high speed up these process by providing a good and extensive library providing assets to this work. In a normal scenario you make a CRUD operation like this:

  1. Create a form to create instances
  1. Validate submitted data
  1. Create a form to edit instances
  1. Validate submitted data
  1. Create a view to display registered instances
  1. Create actions to delete instances

And this operations take a long development time, to supply this needs Rabbit Forms work in another way:

  1. Create configuration file
  1. Create template
  1. Use this

With Rabbit Forms, the creation of a complex form configuration file take near to 10 minutes, the template creation varies depending how custom you need (usually about 5 and 20 minutes) and the use will spend about 5 minutes.

Rabbit Forms is made to be integrated into your site and not to be external of this, read about template above to more information

The Rabbit Forms configuration files contains all you need to your form, like:

  * table that will be used
  * primary key field of table
  * fields
  * validations
  * retrieve options

The fields of Rabbit Forms can vary between simple fields (like text boxes) and most complex fields (like fields that retrieve data from another table, fields that use javascript and ajax codes and more), and the use of all is made in a simple way, and more, the fields is easily extensible, if the field you need is not exists, you can create this field easily.

The validations follow the same base of fields, the validations can be simple or complex and are extensible.

Another great feature of Rabbit Forms is the template customization, Rabbit Forms spend some efforts to make templates is most customizable as possible. Rabbit Forms is made to be integrated in your website, and with template customizing you able to use Rabbit Forms in your page maintaining your site apparency.
